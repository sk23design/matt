It's the eye at the centre of the Snowbombing storm: 400 4 star beds, 2 swimming pools a panoramic gym and stupendous spa area (in which you can keep your swimming stuff ON!), a dozen bars (including the fave hang out of our artists, the Lobby Bar, the Sports Bar and Arena), a sun-kissed lawn and more balconies than the \"Balconies R Us Boxing Day Sale\".</p> <p>Twin and triple rooms are spacious, have en suites with tasteful, traditional decor and the buffet breakfast is vast. In the time you've read this, someone else has just booked a room, so stop reading, take our word for it and reserve a slice of the Strass for yourself and your legs will love you for it (if your pillow was any nearer the Penken lift, you'd need a lift pass to go to bed!)</p>",

Guests at the Garni Strass will be invited to take breakfast and will also be privy to all of the 4* luxury amenities the main building has to offer. Located next door to the main Penken gondola, it has to be the best 3* in town - no gassing.</p> <p>The Strass empire is an awesome axis of accommodation and much, much more. It's the eye at the centre of the Snowbombing storm: 400 4 star beds, 2 swimming pools a panoramic gym and stupendous spa area (in which you can keep your swimming stuff ON!), a dozen bars (including the fave hang out of our artists, the Lobby Bar, the Sports Bar and Arena) and a sun-kissed lawn...and more balconies than the \"Balconies R Us Boxing Day Sale&rdquo;. Twin and triple rooms are spacious, en suite with tasteful traditional decor. In the time you've read this, someone else has just booked a room, so stop reading, take our word for it and reserve a slice of the Strass for yourself and your legs will love you for it (if your pillow was any nearer the Penken lift, you'd need a lift pass to go to bed!)</p>",
